ambiguity
name is define before instructor like in student
so name studnet works but name instructor doesn't  work

type constructor
value constructor

record can have mutable field


with keyword

- references
let r  = ref 0;;

!r
r := 1

incr r
decr r


reference type 

remember things


- arrays
- I/O


io is imperative
; semicolon means sequencing -> do something and do next thing

let print_int_array a =


downto
done
for loop

i = 0 not possible bcus it's immutable! => instead => we use ref 
REFERENCE
sieve of eratosthenes; remaining numbers are all prime number

mapi -> convert it to list 
array can't be resized basically

while ... do
	...
done

for i = 0 to n-1 ... do
done

isprime.(i) <- () 인지 [] 인지 구별 잘 하기

dereferencing !

exception 할 때 Failure _ ->

?? unit type

io is not programming but the feature that provided by os?
standard input becomes the file
__ < __

c file io

---
let rec count acc =
	try
		ignore @@ read_line ();
		count (acc + 1)
	with
	| End_of_file -> acc <- no need to return anything since don't wnat the content but the total # of lines so -> ()

let () = 
	print_int @@ count 0;
	print_newline ()
---

printf function at C

file io to read or returning the information

%d 
just stop when there's something strange

reading string and returning string?

Sacn.sscanf " 123a " " %s"
int_of_string 

open_in "file_name";;

let rec 어쩌구 ic acc =  // input channel


let () =
	for i = 0 to progrma name
